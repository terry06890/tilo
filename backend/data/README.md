File Generation Process
=======================

1   Tree Structure Data
    1   Obtain data in otol/, as specified in it's README.
    2   Run genOtolData.py, which creates data.db, and adds a 'nodes'
        table using data in otol/*.
2   Name Data for Search
    1   Obtain data in eol/, as specified in it's README.
    2   Run genEolNameData.py, which adds 'names' and 'eol\_ids' tables to data.db,
        using data in eol/vernacularNames.csv and the 'nodes' table.
3   Image Data
    1   Use downloadImgsForReview.py to download EOL images into imgsForReview/.
        It uses data in eol/imagesList.db, and the 'eol\_ids' table.
    2   Use reviewImgs.py to filter images in imgsForReview/ into EOL-id-unique
        images in imgsReviewed/ (uses 'names' and 'eol\_ids' to display extra info).
    3   Use genImgsForWeb.py to create cropped/resized images in img/, using
        images in imgsReviewed, and also to add an 'images' table to data.db.
4   Node Description Data
    -   Using DBpedia
        1   Obtain data in dbpedia/, as specified in it's README.
        2   Run genDbpData.py, which adds a 'descs' table to data.db, using
            data in dbpedia/dbpData.db, dbpPickedLabels.txt, and the 'nodes' table.
    -   Using wikipedia dump (old method)
        1   Obtain data in enwiki/, as specified in it's README.
        2   Run genEnwikiData.py, which adds a 'descs' table to data.db,
            using data in enwiki/enwikiData.db, and the 'nodes' table.
5   Reduced Tree Structure Data
    1   Run genReducedTreeData.py, which adds a 'reduced_nodes' table to data.db,
        using reducedTol/names.txt, and the 'nodes' and 'names' tables.

data.db Tables
==============
-   nodes:          name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, children TEXT, parent TEXT, tips INT, p\_support INT
-   names:          name TEXT, alt\_name TEXT, pref\_alt INT, PRIMARY KEY(name, alt\_name)
-   eol\_ids:       id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT
-   images:         eol\_id INT PRIMARY KEY, source\_url TEXT, license TEXT, copyright\_owner TEXT
-   descs:          name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, desc TEXT, redirected INT
-   reduced\_nodes: name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, children TEXT, parent TEXT, tips INT, p\_support INT

Other Files
===========
-   dbpPickedLabels.txt <br>
    Contains DBpedia labels, one per line. Used by genDbpData.py to help
    resolve conflicts when associating tree-of-life node names with
    DBpedia node labels. Was generated by manually editing the output
    of genDbpConflicts.py.
-   genDbpConflicts.py <br>
    Reads data from dbpedia/dbpData.db, and the 'nodes' table of data.db,
    and looks for potential conflicts that would arise when genDbpData.db
    tries to associate tree-of-life node names wth DBpedia node labels. It
    writes data about them to conflicts.txt, which can be manually edited
    to resolve them.
