File Generation Process
=======================
1   Tree Structure Data
    1   Obtain data in otol/, as specified in it's README.
    2   Run genOtolData.py, which creates data.db, and adds
        'nodes' and 'edges' tables using data in otol/*, as well as
        genOtolNamesToKeep.txt, if present.
2   Name Data for Search
    1   Obtain data in eol/, as specified in it's README.
    2   Run genEolNameData.py, which adds 'names' and 'eol\_ids' tables to data.db,
        using data in eol/vernacularNames.csv and the 'nodes' table.
3   Image Data
    1   In eol/, run downloadImgs.py to download EOL images into eol/imgsForReview/.
        It uses data in eol/imagesList.db, and the 'eol\_ids' table.
    2   In eol/, run reviewImgs.py to filter images in eol/imgsForReview/ into EOL-id-unique
        images in eol/imgsReviewed/ (uses 'names' and 'eol\_ids' to display extra info).
    3   Run genImgsForWeb.py to create cropped/resized images in img/, using
        images in eol/imgsReviewed/, and also to add an 'images' table to data.db.
    4   Run genLinkedImgs.py to add a 'linked_imgs' table to data.db,
        which uses 'nodes', 'edges', 'eol\_ids', and 'images', to associate
        nodes without images to child images.
4   Node Description Data
    1   Obtain data in dbpedia/, as specified in it's README.
    2   Run genDbpData.py, which adds a 'descs' table to data.db, using
        data in dbpedia/dbpData.db, dbpPickedLabels.txt, and the 'nodes' table.
5   Supplementary Name/Description Data
    1   Obtain data in enwiki/, as specified in it's README.
    2   Run genEnwikiDescData.py, which adds to the 'descs' table, using data in
        enwiki/enwikiData.db, and the 'nodes' table. Also uses genEnwikiDesc*.txt
        files for skipping/resolving some name-page associations.
    3   Run genEnwikiNameData.py, which adds to the 'names' table, using data in
        enwiki/enwikiData.db, and the 'names' and 'descs' tables.
5   Reduced Tree Structure Data
    1   Run genReducedTreeData.py, which adds 'r_nodes' and 'r_edges' tables to
        data.db, using reducedTol/names.txt, and the 'nodes' and 'names' tables.

data.db Tables
==============
-   nodes:        name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, tips INT
-   edges:        node TEXT, child TEXT, p\_support INT, PRIMARY KEY (node, child)
-   names:        name TEXT, alt\_name TEXT, pref\_alt INT, PRIMARY KEY(name, alt\_name)
-   eol\_ids:     id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT
-   images:       eol\_id INT PRIMARY KEY, source\_url TEXT, license TEXT, copyright\_owner TEXT
-   linked\_imgs: name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, eol\_id INT, eol\_id2 INT
-   descs:        name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, desc TEXT, redirected INT, wiki\_id INT, from\_dbp INT
-   r\_nodes:     name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, tips INT
-   r\_edges:     node TEXT, child TEXT, p\_support INT, PRIMARY KEY (node, child)

Other Files
===========
-   dbpPickedLabels.txt <br>
    Contains DBpedia labels, one per line. Used by genDbpData.py to help
    resolve conflicts when associating tree-of-life node names with
    DBpedia node labels. Was generated by manually editing the output
    of genDbpConflicts.py.
-   genDbpConflicts.py <br>
    Reads data from dbpedia/dbpData.db, and the 'nodes' table of data.db,
    and looks for potential conflicts that would arise when genDbpData.db
    tries to associate tree-of-life node names wth DBpedia node labels. It
    writes data about them to conflicts.txt, which can be manually edited
    to resolve them.
-   genOtolNamesToKeep.txt <br>
    Contains names to avoid trimming off the tree data generated by
    genOtolData.py.  Usage is optional, but, without it, a large amount
    of possibly-significant nodes are removed, using a short-sighted
    heuristic. <br>
    One way to generate this list is to generate the files as usual,
    then get node names that have an associated image, description, or
    presence in r_nodes. Then run the genOtolData.py and genEolNameData.py
    scripts again (after deleting their created tables).
-   genEnwikiDescNamesToSkip.txt <br>
    Contains names for nodes that genEnwikiNameData.py should skip adding
    a description for. Usage is optional, but without it, some nodes will
    probably get descriptions that don't match (eg: the bee genus Osiris
    might be described as an egyptian god). <br>
    This file was generated by running genEnwikiNameData.py, then listing
    the names that it added into a file, along with descriptions, and
    manually removing those that seemed node-matching (got about 30k lines,
    with about 1 in 30 descriptions non-matching). And, after creating
    genEnwikiDescTitlesToUse.txt, names shared with that file were removed.
-   genEnwikiDescTitlesToUse.txt <br>
    Contains enwiki titles with the form 'name1 (category1)' for
    genEnwikiNameData.py to use to resolve nodes matching name name1.
    Usage is optional, but it adds some descriptions that would otherwise
    be skipped. <br>
    This file was generated by taking the content of genEnwikiNameData.py,
    after the manual filtering step, then, for each name name,1 getting
    page titles from dbpedia/dbpData.db that match 'name1 (category1)'.
    This was followed by manually removing lines, keeping those that
    seemed to match the corresponding node (used the app to help with this).
