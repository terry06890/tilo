This directory holds additional image files to use for tree-of-life nodes,
on top of those from EOL and Wikipedia.

Possible Files
==============
-   (Image files)
-   imgData.txt <br>
    Contains lines with the format `filename|url|license|artist|credit`.
    The filename should consist of a node name, with an image extension.
    Other fields correspond to those in the `images` table (see ../README.md).
