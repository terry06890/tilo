Grid of Life
============

An interactive visualisation of the biological tree of life.

Each tile represents a group of organisms with a common ancestor.
-   Clicking on a tile expands it into tiles representing direct descendants.
    If there are too many other tiles, there might not be room to expand.
-   Clicking on an expanded tile collapses it back into one tile.
-   Double-clicking on a tile expands it to fill the whole view.
    Other tiles will be moved to the side.
